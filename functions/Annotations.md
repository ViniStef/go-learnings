## Functions
<li>In Go, the variable type comes after the variable name: Here, func sub(x int, y int) int is known as the "function signature".</li>

## Type Declarations Examples
<li>x int</li>
<li>p *int</li>
<li>a [3]int</li>

## Passing Variables as Values
<li>when a variable is passed into a function, that function receives a copy of the variable. The function is unable to mutate the caller's original data.</li>
